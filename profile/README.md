## Overview

**DJI Battery Health Monitor** is a safety-first diagnostic and logging tool for monitoring DJI battery health parameters such as per-cell voltages, temperatures, cycle counts and charge/discharge history. The project focuses on analysis, reporting and safe handling recommendations. This tool explicitly does not provide methods to bypass manufacturer protections or unlock batteries.

## Key Features (safe & legal)

- 📊 Visualize battery metrics: per-cell voltage, overall SOC, temperature, cycle count.  
- 📈 Save and export charge/discharge history and logs (CSV).  
- 🔔 Configurable alerts for over-temperature, undervoltage, and excessive cycle count.  
- 📝 Generate battery health reports for service records.  
- 🔍 Indicators of degradation trends (voltage imbalance, reduced capacity) — indicative only; advanced measurements require proper hardware.  
- 🔗 Use official log exports or read-only device interfaces when supported.  
- 🔒 Built-in safety tips: recommended charging/storage/disposal guidelines.
